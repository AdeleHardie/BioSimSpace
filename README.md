# BioSimSpace

Code and resources for the EPSRC [BioSimSpace](https://biosimspace.org) project.

To install into a [Sire](https://github.com/michellab/Sire) package, use:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Note that this assumes that the Sire's `bin` directory, `$HOME/sire.app/bin`,
has been added to your path. Alternatively, run:

```bash
$HOME/sire.app/bin/python setup.py install
```
We recommend using the `devel` branch of [Sire](https://github.com/michellab/Sire)
to make sure that you have access to the latest features and bug-fixes.
